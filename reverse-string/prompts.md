# Vanilla JavaScript Reverse String Application
# ChatBot: Claude 3 Haiku

## First prompt
Create a vanilla JavaScript simple app to invert the order of a user input text in real-time. You are given the following 'index.html' file structure and a sample image of the desired styling. The logic must be included in an 'script.js' file and the styling must be injected directly to the html, that is, no css extra file should be generated. Stick as close as possible to the sample image:

html structure:
```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Reverse String</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <script src="script.js"></script>
      </body>
  </html>
```

## Second prompt
add a 'copy to clipboard button' below the reversed text only visible when the reversed text is shown. The text of the button must be 'Copy' and the styling is based on the sample image provided previously
